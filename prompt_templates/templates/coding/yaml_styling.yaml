  A reusable prompt style for generating clean and consistent YAML files.
style_prompt: |
  This is a styling prompt:
  - Follow YAML 1.2 specification
  - Use 2 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
  - Keep keys in lower_snake_case unless otherwise required
  - Use consistent quoting rules (prefer double quotes only when necessary)
  - Lists should be properly indented and hyphen-aligned
  - Keep YAML minimal and human-readable
  - Add comments for non-obvious sections
labels: [yaml, linting, formatting, configuration, clean-style]
